# DSC383W-HAR-Classification
## Utilizing Machine Learning Techniques to classify the UCI Human Activity Recognition dataset.

The project description asked us to create at least two machine learning models to predict the activity (walking, running, laying etc) based on the 561 features.
I created a gradient boosted tree model, svm model, and neural network model. 
I then used model feature importances to create reduced models while still retaining a desired accuracy.
The results are discussed in the included "Mini Project Report.pdf".
